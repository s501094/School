Your project contains the NBA data set and a Jupyter Notebook with your Python scripts. In the notebook, you will find step-by-step instructions and code blocks that will help you complete the following tasks:
    a. Choose and create a data visualization.
    b. Calculate descriptive statistics including mean, median, min, max, variance, and standard deviation.
    c.  Construct confidence intervals for a population proportion and a population mean.


  2. ### Summary Report: Once you have completed all the steps in your Python script, you will create a summary report to present your findings. Use the provided template to create your report. You must complete each of the following sections:
    a. Introduction: Set the context for your scenario and the analyses you will be performing.
    b. Data Visualization: Identify and interpret your chosen data visualization.
    c. Descriptive Statistics: Identify and interpret measures of central tendency and variability.
    d. bold and italidConfidence Intervals: Identify and interpret the lower and upper limits of confidence intervals.
    e. Conclusion: Summarize your findings and explain their practical implications.
