README: DriverPass Portfolio Reflection

Overview of the DriverPass Project

The DriverPass project involved designing a comprehensive system for a client named DriverPass, a company focused on helping individuals prepare for their driver’s license exams. They wanted an online platform where customers could schedule driving lessons, take practice tests, and stay current with the latest DMV regulations. My role was to gather the requirements from the client and translate them into two key documents: a business requirements document and a system design document. These artifacts illustrate how I analyzed DriverPass’s needs and created a plan for implementing a secure, user-friendly system.

What Went Well and Potential Revisions

I am proud of how clearly I defined the functional requirements, breaking them down into sections such as user management, reservation management, package management, and DMV integration. This organization made it easier for both technical and nontechnical stakeholders to understand what the system would do. If I could revise one part, I would focus more on the user interface design elements. While the documents covered functional aspects thoroughly, providing additional mockups or wireframes could have offered a richer visual insight into how customers and staff would interact with the system. More detailed UI guidance might further reduce confusion during the development phase.

Interpreting User Needs

When designing the system, I carefully reviewed interview transcripts and iterated on the requirements to ensure the final plan addressed every concern Liam (the owner) and Ian (the IT officer) raised. I recognized that a proper understanding of their day-to-day operations—like scheduling lessons, handling reservations, and integrating new DMV rules—was crucial to building a system that truly served their business. It is vital to keep user needs at the forefront because software that does not reflect actual workflows or preferences can be frustrating and ineffective, no matter how advanced its features.

Approach to Software Design and Future Strategies

My general approach to designing software starts with gathering and synthesizing requirements, then modeling the system using UML diagrams such as use case, activity, sequence, and class diagrams. For future projects, I will continue using these diagrams alongside techniques like use-case analysis and user stories. This combination helps keep the focus on what real users want to accomplish, ensuring that any technical solution remains grounded in practical needs. Early prototyping and frequent stakeholder feedback are also key strategies I will apply to refine system designs before full-scale development begins.
